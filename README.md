# PacManSearchAlgorithms

This is the first Introduction to AI assignement at UFMG. Had to implement known search algorithms like Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, Greedy Search and A Star Search, the last two using a heuristic. They all were tested in a PacMan map that was already implemented. The only file I had to implement the algorithms was search.py.

The assignment specifications and the documentation for what I've done are in the two pdf files. Both are in portuguese.
